I’m not sure if you remember me but I defintely remember you. You were one of the original people who are truly beautiful in and out

thanks for helping me get in the spirit of just making…

I know how cliche it is to say this, but you really are an amazing person!

Happy birthday. To many dreams and sleepless nights yet to come. Feels like we’re still just at the beginning and I know we’ll look back on today embarrassed by how little we knew


A 19 years of madness and I know this isn't going to stop as age is just a Number. A birthday like today must be memorable and unforgettable. Never lose your stunning smile!. You always shine like the sun and spread joy and love to everyone around you. You are one of the best souls we've ever met. What else can we say, Crazy Girl who Cares a lot ❤, Thank You So Much for being a part for our life. HAPPY BIRTHDAY stay blessed keeping ROCK and ROLLING.
